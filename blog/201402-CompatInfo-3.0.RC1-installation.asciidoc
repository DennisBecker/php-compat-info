When I've packaged the PHAR version, I've not used any specific stub, but just
the same launcher as git https://github.com/llaville/php-compat-info/blob/v3/bin/compatinfo[source code version]. 

This is major reason you need to have previously installed PHP_Timer and Symfony/Class-Loader 2.4 or better.

I'll fix this issue, to have a really phar version without any dependencies in first Release Candidate.

Be aware, and sorry for disappointment !
